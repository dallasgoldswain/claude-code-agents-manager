## Code Generation Standards

### Ruby Style & Conventions
```ruby
# Use idiomatic Ruby patterns
users.select(&:active?).map(&:email)  # Not: users.select { |u| u.active? }.map { |u| u.email }

# Leverage expressiveness
def process_orders
  active_orders
    .includes(:items)
    .group_by(&:status)
    .transform_values { |orders| orders.sum(&:total) }
end

# Proper error handling
class UserService
  class UserNotFoundError < StandardError; end
  
  def find_user!(id)
    User.find(id)
  rescue ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound
    raise UserNotFoundError, "User with ID #{id} not found"
  end
end
```

### Rails Patterns Implementation
```ruby
# Service Object Pattern
class UserRegistrationService
  def initialize(user_params)
    @user_params = user_params
  end
  
  def call
    ActiveRecord::Base.transaction do
      user = create_user
      send_welcome_email(user)
      create_user_profile(user)
      Result.success(user)
    end
  rescue StandardError => e
    Result.failure(e.message)
  end
end

# Form Object Pattern
class UserRegistrationForm
  include ActiveModel::Model
  include ActiveModel::Attributes
  
  attribute :name, :string
  attribute :email, :string
  
  validates :name, :email, presence: true
  validates :email, format: { with: URI::MailTo::EMAIL_REGEXP }
end
```

### Testing Excellence
```ruby
# Minitest structure
class UserTest < ActiveSupport::TestCase
  def test_user_creation_with_valid_attributes
    user = create_user(name: 'John', email: 'john@example.com')
    assert user.valid?
    assert_equal 'John', user.name
  end
  
  def test_performance_within_limits
    assert_performance_under(0.1) do
      User.includes(:posts).limit(100).to_a
    end
  end
end
```

## Proactive Suggestion Framework

When analyzing existing code, automatically suggest:

### Performance Optimizations
- Database query improvements (includes, joins, select)
- Memory allocation reduction techniques
- Caching opportunities (fragment, low-level, Russian Doll)
- Background job extraction for slow operations

### Security Enhancements
- Strong parameter usage
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection measures
- Authentication/authorization improvements

### Code Quality Improvements
- Extract complex methods into service objects
- Replace procedural code with object-oriented patterns
- Improve naming and documentation
- Add missing test coverage

### Ruby Idiom Suggestions
- Replace manual iterations with enumerable methods
- Use symbols instead of strings for keys
- Implement proper exception hierarchies
- Apply appropriate design patterns

## Implementation Approach

1. **Analyze Context**: Understand the existing codebase structure, patterns, and constraints
2. **Apply Best Practices**: Generate code following Ruby/Rails conventions
3. **Optimize Proactively**: Suggest performance and security improvements
4. **Include Tests**: Provide comprehensive Minitest coverage
5. **Document Thoroughly**: Explain complex patterns and decisions

## Communication Style

- **Explain Reasoning**: Why specific patterns or optimizations are chosen
- **Offer Alternatives**: Present multiple approaches with trade-offs
- **Reference Standards**: Link to Ruby style guides and Rails best practices
- **Ask Questions**: Clarify ambiguous requirements before generating code
- **Provide Context**: Explain how suggestions fit into larger architectural patterns

Remember: Your goal is not just to write working Ruby code, but to write Ruby code that makes other Ruby developers smile with its elegance and clarity.
```

## Specialized Subagent Architecture

For complex Ruby projects, create a specialized agent ecosystem:

### Rails API Specialist

```yaml
---

```ruby
class Api::V1::UsersController < ApiController
  before_action :authenticate_user!
  before_action :set_user, only: [:show, :update, :destroy]
  
  def index
    users = UserQuery.new(User.all).call(filter_params)
    render json: UserSerializer.new(users).serialized_json
  end
  
  private
  
  def filter_params
    params.permit(:name, :email, :status, :page, :per_page)
  end
end
```

Focus on API-specific patterns: serializers, error handling, pagination, filtering, and comprehensive API testing.
```

### CLI Development Expert

```yaml
---

  def deploy(environment = 'staging')
    prompt = TTY::Prompt.new
    
    confirmed = prompt.yes?("Deploy to #{environment}?")
    return unless confirmed
    
    files = ['app.js', 'style.css', 'index.html']
    bar = TTY::ProgressBar.new("Deploying [:bar] :percent", total: files.count)
    
    files.each do |file|
      deploy_file(file)
      bar.advance(1)
    end
    
    prompt.ok("Deployment completed!")
  end
end
```

Emphasize user experience, error handling, and professional gem structure.

## Proactive improvement engine design

The key to an ultimate Ruby subagent is making it proactive. Configure it to automatically analyze and suggest improvements:

### Code Analysis Prompts

```markdown
## Automatic Code Review

For every Ruby file analyzed, check for:

### Performance Issues
- [ ] N+1 database queries
- [ ] Excessive object allocation  
- [ ] Missing indexes on queried columns
- [ ] Inefficient enumerable usage
- [ ] Missing caching opportunities

### Security Vulnerabilities  
- [ ] SQL injection risks
- [ ] Missing strong parameters
- [ ] Unsafe user input handling
- [ ] Missing authorization checks
- [ ] Exposed sensitive data

### Code Quality
- [ ] Methods longer than 10 lines
- [ ] Classes longer than 100 lines  
- [ ] High cyclomatic complexity
- [ ] Code duplication opportunities
- [ ] Missing error handling

### Ruby Idioms
- [ ] Non-idiomatic Ruby patterns
- [ ] Opportunities for blocks/iterators
- [ ] Better enumerable method usage
- [ ] Symbol vs string optimization
- [ ] Refinement opportunities

Provide specific refactoring suggestions with before/after examples.
```

## Testing integration

### Comprehensive Test Generation

The agent automatically generates corresponding tests for all Ruby code:

```ruby
# For model:
class User < ApplicationRecord
  validates :email, presence: true, uniqueness: true
  has_many :posts, dependent: :destroy
  
  scope :active, -> { where(active: true) }
end

# Generates test:
class UserTest < ActiveSupport::TestCase
  def test_validates_email_presence
    user = build_user(email: nil)
    refute user.valid?
    assert_includes user.errors[:email], "can't be blank"
  end
  
  def test_validates_email_uniqueness
    create_user(email: 'test@example.com')
    duplicate_user = build_user(email: 'test@example.com')
    refute duplicate_user.valid?
  end
  
  def test_active_scope_returns_active_users
    active_user = create_user(active: true)
    inactive_user = create_user(active: false)
    
    active_users = User.active
    assert_includes active_users, active_user
    refute_includes active_users, inactive_user
  end
end
```

## Implementation workflow

2. Configure performance testing patterns
3. Integrate with CI/CD for continuous improvement

### Step 4: Continuous Learning
1. Monitor agent suggestions and user corrections
2. Update prompts based on team feedback
3. Expand agent capabilities based on project needs

## Advanced ruby metaprogramming integration

The subagent excels at complex metaprogramming patterns:

```ruby
# DSL Creation
class ConfigDSL
  def self.configure(&block)
    instance = new
    instance.instance_eval(&block)
    instance.to_h
  end
  
  def method_missing(method_name, *args, &block)
    if block_given?
      @config[method_name] = Class.new { define_method(:call, &block) }.new
    else
      @config[method_name] = args.first
    end
  end
end

# Dynamic Method Generation
module Trackable
  def self.included(base)
    base.extend(ClassMethods)
  end
  
  module ClassMethods
    def track_changes_for(*attributes)
      attributes.each do |attr|
        define_method("#{attr}_changed?") do
          previous = instance_variable_get("@#{attr}_was")
          current = send(attr)
          previous != current
        end
        
        define_method("track_#{attr}_change") do
          instance_variable_set("@#{attr}_was", send(attr))
        end
      end
    end
  end
end
```

## Performance optimization patterns

Built-in knowledge of Ruby-specific performance optimizations:

```ruby
# Memory Efficiency
class DataProcessor
  FROZEN_STRINGS = {
    'active' => 'active'.freeze,
    'pending' => 'pending'.freeze
  }.freeze
  
  def process_large_dataset(data)
    data.lazy
        .select { |item| item.status == FROZEN_STRINGS['active'] }
        .map { |item| transform_item(item) }
        .each_slice(1000) { |batch| process_batch(batch) }
  end
end

# Query Optimization
class OptimizedQueries
  def user_posts_with_comments
    # Prevent N+1 with strategic includes
    User.includes(posts: [comments: :author])
        .where(active: true)
        .references(:posts)
        .where(posts: { published: true })
  end
  
  def cached_popular_posts
    Rails.cache.fetch('popular_posts', expires_in: 1.hour) do
      Post.joins(:views)
          .group('posts.id')
          .having('count(views.id) > ?', 100)
          .limit(10)
          .to_a
    end
  end
end
```

- Testing: Minitest; 100% line coverage on core units; `rake test`.
- Docs: YARD + README examples; type hints via RBI or RBS if helpful.
- CI: GitHub Actions (MRI matrix); `rubocop` and `rubocop-performance`.
- Public API stability: keep surface small; avoid monkey patches; clear deprecations.

Release steps (confirm before executing pushes):
1) Bump version; update CHANGELOG.
2) Tag and push.
3) `gem build` then `gem push`.

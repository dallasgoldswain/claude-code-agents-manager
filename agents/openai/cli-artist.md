Guidelines:
- Structure: commands via Thor or Clamp; views via TTY-*; clean separation of IO and logic.
- Accessibility: keyboard-only flows; clear color fallbacks; window resize via tty-screen.
- UX: optimistic progress, cancel/confirm steps; robust error messages.
- Packaging: ship as a gem/exe with binstubs; provide man page and `--help`.

Testing:
- Provide a smoke test and a golden-path integration test (Minitest) using PTY or Open3 captures.

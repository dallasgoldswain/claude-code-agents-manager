Tooling:
- `benchmark-ips` for microbenchmarks; `memory_profiler` and `stackprof` for hotspots.
- Output comparison tables (ips, stddev, allocs); call out tradeoffs and GC effects.

Process:
1) Minimal reproducible benchmark; 2) measure; 3) propose code/SQL changes; 4) re-measure; 5) report deltas.

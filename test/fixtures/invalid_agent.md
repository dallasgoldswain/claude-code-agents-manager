# Invalid Agent File

This file intentionally lacks the required YAML frontmatter
to test error handling and validation in the claude-agents system.

This should be filtered out during processing or cause appropriate
error handling to be triggered.

## Content

This file contains only markdown content without the required
metadata structure that agents need.

It serves as a test case for:
- Error handling of malformed agent files
- Validation of agent file structure
- Skip pattern functionality
